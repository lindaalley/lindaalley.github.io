---




Global economic crisis equals reduced holiday budget, which equals poor quality food, right? Not in Krakow, Poland. Offering the same high gastronomical standards as Paris and Rome, you won't need to take out a bank loan to eat and drink here. Both Krakow's old town and its traditional recipes have survived unscathed from the bombs of the Second World War. Once you arrive, don't be afraid to put your map away. Exploring the labyrinth of ancient streets can lead to unusual culinary adventures. Unassuming names and quiet appearances can sometimes be deceptive. More often than not, inside these places are thriving with local life, a sure testament to the quality of the cuisine. Perhaps that's the secret to Poland's current economic growth. Here are three intriguing local haunts to get you started.

**Pierogarnie**

If you want to eat in, arrive early. The five tables of Pierogarnie fill up fast and the clientele show that this place is not just a cheap and tasty option for those with foreign currency in their pockets. Conveniently located near the market square, this intimate cafe is popular with the local youth.
The dried herbs, which hang from the walls, create the illusion of a farmhouse kitchen. Menu cards pegged to a clothes line list 14 different varieties of pierogi or dumplings, a Polish staple.
Fillings range from traditional (ground meat, mushrooms, potatoes and onion) to sweet (apples and cream). However those who do not eat meat should beware - the “vegetarian” pierogi (spinach and white cheese) are served sprinkled with bacon bits! These slimy grey capsules may look unappealing, but pierogi are packed with flavour and surprisingly filling for their size. A paper plateful will set you back a mere 12 zl.

**Wódka Cafe Car**

A short walk from Pierogarnie, Wódka Cafe Bar will soon show you why the locals fill up on pierogi before going out. Crowded with locals, this tiny bar is simply furnished with a few tables and stools downstairs. A ladder-like staircase leads up to a second room the size of tree hut with a broom cupboard toilet.
Although the bar's name needs no translation for foreigners, the long Polish drinks list is a little more difficult. Fortunately the staff are more than happy to share their knowledge of Poland's national drink. Those who have been dragged in by vodka-loving friends will be relieved to hear that alternative tipples are also available.
However, Krupnik is one vodka shot you must try while you're in Krakow. This sweet, golden-coloured vodka, made from honey and spices, is a Polish favorite. Others varieties on offer include chocolate, mandarin and apple. Those looking for a more fiery taste should try chilli or plum vodka. The extensive choice and appealing price of 7 zl a shot is an irresistible combination. Don't be surprised if Wódka becomes your local watering hole while you're in Krakow.

**Klezmer Hois**

You haven't truly sampled Krakow's food and drink until you've visited the Kazimierz, the city's Jewish quarter. After exploring the surrounding synagogues and cemeteries, Klezmer Hois makes a perfect stop for a longer, more leisurely meal.
Tucked away on a quiet street corner, it's easy to be fooled into thinking that this hotel restaurant is closed. But if you venture inside after 8pm, there is a good chance that your arrival will be greeted by the accordion, viola and double bass. The hotel is a regular venue for Jewish bands.
It's easy to forget you're in the twenty first century as you relax on couches or gather around cozy lace-covered tables. Portraits and old maps line the red walls.
There are a wide selection of soups available including several varieties of the popular barszcz (beetroot soup). Duck pate, carrot salad , carp, turkey livers, omelettes and kosher wine highlight the range of Klezmer Hois' extensive menu, which has options for every taste and budget. For an authentic Jewish meal, try liver-stuffed goose necks (29.30 zl) followed by purim cake (5 zl) for dessert. Those with queasy stomachs should rest easy: the goose necks look safely like two fat sausages – served without feathers.

At the time of writing, one Polish Zloty was equal to 0.37 AUD, 0.20 GBP and 0.24 EUR.
