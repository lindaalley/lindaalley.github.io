Have you ever tried sitting in a language class for four hours a day, every day? Adults need games at school too! Here are three of my favourites.

## **What´s the sound?**

### Level: Upper intermediate and above

OK, I have to admit I pinched this one from a colleague. Get everyone standing in a circle. Start by saying any word. For example, ´cats ´. The student next to you must think of a word beginning with the same sound that this word ends with. The final sound is /s/ so the next student could say ´shopped´. If the next student then says ´dog´, he/she has to sit down, because of course, the final sound of ´shopped´ is actually /t/. The last student left standing is the winner. It´s a great way to remind students that English words are often pronounced very differently from their spelling.

## Tell me a story….and link each sentence.

### Level: Intermediate and above. Also good for IELTS and EAP students.

Although, however, on the other hand, nevertheless, whereas…

Let´s face it. Linking words are not a particularly enjoyable subject for either students or teachers. This game will wake up your students as well as giving them a memorable context for these tricky expressions. Again, arrange the class in a circle, either seated or standing. Start by telling a story with the following opening line:

One morning (insert student´s name e.g. Tiffany) and (insert another student´s name e.g. Andres) were going to the airport. (Tiffany) decided to take a taxi whereas (Andres) decided to take the train.

The student next to you continues the story. He/she can say one or two sentences, but must use at least one linking word. For example:

Although, Tiffany had left her house early, there was a lot of traffic…

The next student continues and so on. Correct linker errors on the spot, eliciting the correct alternatives from other students so that everyone understands. This is a useful game to play before asking your students to write an academic essay.
## Make your own board game
### All levels.

Can´t find a board game for the grammar or vocabulary you´ve covered class? Make your own! It´s not as time-consuming as it sounds. Just do an internet search for ´board game template´ to find the outline. Print it out, write what you want in the squares and photocopy it. 

I recently prepared a board game with a phrasal verb written in each square. If students landed on ´put out ´, they had to make a sentence using that particular verb. Another advantage of designing your own board game is that you can write something in every space. No more silent students waiting to land on a square with a question!
