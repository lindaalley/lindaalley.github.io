title: Three pronunciation games
---

Pronunciation can be easily overlooked in ESL classes as it is often not included in exams in the same way as the other core language skills. Yet pronunciation is crucial not only to the speaking components of formal exams such as IELTS, but to a person's ability to communicate and be understood within the English-speaking world. Here are three games which will help you to incorporate more pronunciation into your classes in a fun, constructive way.

### 1. Musical chairs

You probably remember this from children's birthday parties. In this version, students sit in chairs in a circle. The teacher stands in the middle. Choose three sounds you would like to focus on (e.g. /v/  /w/  /f/). Each student is given a sound. The teacher calls out one of the sounds (e.g. /w/). Every student who has this sound must go and sit in a different chair. Meanwhile, you quickly sit in one of the empty chairs. The student who is left standing in the middle must call out another sound. There is also a fourth alternative. If the person in the middle calls out the word pronunciation everyone must change seats but cannot move to the seat directly on their left or right. 

This game is a great way to practise very similar sounds as the person in the middle must pronounce their sound very clearly and the students in the chairs must listen carefully. For stronger classes, you could get them to call out a word containing their sound.

### 2. Memory drill

Write ten words on the board containing your target sound(s). Write them in two columns of five. Drill all the words. Then rub out one word. Students repeat the drill including the missing word. Repeat, each time rubbing out one or two words. At the end, you will have an empty board and students should try to chant all the words in order.

### 3. Tell me a story

Make a list of words that your students find difficult to pronounce. You are going to tell a story as a class. You could include some of the students as characters. Give the students the first line. For example: "One day Carlos went on holiday to an island. Everyone should repeat the word island. The next student continues: "It was an island in the Pacific with lots of interesting fruits and vegetables. Everyone repeats the word vegetables etc.

Enjoy!
