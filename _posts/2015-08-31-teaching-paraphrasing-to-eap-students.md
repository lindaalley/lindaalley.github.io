title: Teaching paraphrasing to EAP students
---




Paraphrasing is one of the most difficult skills for English language students to master. In many cultures, copying straight from a text is seen as a mark of respect for the author.
So how can we teach students to avoid plagiarism?

**Paraphrasing techniques**

-          Use synonyms
-          Change the structure or word order of sentences
-          Change word forms (e.g. noun to verb)
-          Change the focus of the sentence (e.g. active to passive or use antonyms)

It’s important to stress to your students that paraphrasing is writing someone else’s ideas in their own words WITHOUT changing the meaning. For this reason, some words such as names and places should not be replaced.

**Controlled paraphrasing practice**

Students need a wide vocabulary and a high level of grammatical accuracy to paraphrase correctly. Start with non-academic texts to make it easier for them. One line movie quotations work well. Talk them through the stages of paraphrasing with a series of check questions.

Example 1: Let’s take Darth Vader’s immortal lines from The Empire Strikes Back.

“I am your father.”

Can we replace the word ‘father’?
I am your daddy. Doesn’t quite have the same ring to it, does it?
What about if we change the focus of the sentence? If I am your father, what are you to me?

Paraphrase: You are my son.

Example 2:

“Mamma always said life was like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get.” (Forest Gump)

Which words cannot be replaced? Life.
What is a synonym for ‘mamma’? Mother.
And a synonym for ‘said’? Told.
In what way is life like a box of chocolates? It is unpredictable. It is full of surprises.

Paraphrase: My mother always told me life was unpredictable.

Example 3:

“I’ll never let go, Jack. I’ll never let go.” (Titanic)

Which words cannot be replaced? Jack.
What is the opposite of ‘let go’? Hold on.

Paraphrase: I’ll keep holding on, Jack. I’ll keep holding on.

Example 4:

“I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.” (Casablanca)

Which words are difficult to replace? Friendship. We could say relationship but the meaning isn’t clear.
What is a synonym for ‘beautiful’? Wonderful.
What is a synonym for ‘beginning’? Start.
Can we change the word form? We could change ‘start’ from a noun to a verb.
What is another way to say ‘I think’? ‘I believe’ or ‘in my opinion’.

Paraphrase: In my opinion, a wonderful friendship is starting.

Now, give students a list of movie quotations to paraphrase in pairs. Remind them to keep asking themselves the check questions.

**Free paraphrasing practice**

Divide the class into two groups and hand out two different short stories. When students have read the stories, ask them to choose a partner from the other group and tell each other their stories. Collect the stories back before you do this. If students don’t have a copy of the text in front of them, they won’t be tempted to read from the paper. They will have to summarize the story in their own words. When they’ve told each other the stories, ask them to write a summary. When they’ve finished, they can compare their writing with the original text.

This is also a useful technique for students to try at home if they have to write a summary of an academic text.
