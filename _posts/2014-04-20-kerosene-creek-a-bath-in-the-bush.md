title: "Kerosene Creek: A bath in the bush"
---

Five minutes' walk down a bush track, Kerosene Creek widens into a natural swimming hole. What doesn't seem quite so natural is the steam rising up from the river. Right now, the water of Kerosene Creek is probably about 38°C. A woman showers underneath the mini waterfall that plunges into the pool. Others lounge on the banks, cooling down among the ferns.

But this hot waterfall, like many other springs and geysers in New Zealand, is caused by natural geothermal activity beneath the earth´s surface.

You won´t find any glossy brochures on Kerosene Creek in the Tourist Information shop in Rotorua. Nor is it well sign-posted. From Rotorua, head south on State Highway 5 towards Taupo. After about 30km, turn left onto the Old Waiotapu Road (unsealed) and continue for about 2km to a clearing on the side of the road. Park your car and follow the bush track down to the swimming hole.

There are no changing rooms, massages, fluffy towels or wifi connections. But nor are there any exorbitant entry fees.

Relax your mind, body and wallet with a bath in the bush at Kerosene Creek. 




Note: There have been thefts in the past at Kerosene Creek, but you should be fine if you visit during daylight hours and avoid leaving valuables in your car or unattended.
